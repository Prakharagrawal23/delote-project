# Introduction to Login and Sign-Up Page Using React, Vite, Node.js, Express, Nodemon, and Mongoose

Building a Login and Sign-Up page is a fundamental part of creating modern web applications, where user authentication is crucial for accessing personalized and secure features. In this project, we will create a Login and Sign-Up page using a modern full-stack JavaScript approach, involving React (with Vite) for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB (with Mongoose) for the database. This setup will allow us to efficiently handle user authentication with clean, scalable, and responsive code.

## Technologies Used:

### Frontend:
- **React (with Vite):** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite is a fast and optimized build tool for modern web development.
- **Axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Router DOM:** Used for routing between the Login and Sign-Up pages.

### Backend:
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend of the application.
- **Express:** A web framework for Node.js, which provides routing and middleware support.
- **Nodemon:** A tool that helps with automatic server restarts when code changes, useful during development.

### Database:
- **MongoDB (with Mongoose):** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores user data, and Mongoose is used to model and manage the database schemas in a structured manner.

## Overview of the Login and Sign-Up Flow:

### Sign-Up Page:
1. The user will provide basic information such as name, email, and password.
2. This data will be validated on the frontend and then sent to the backend using an HTTP POST request.
3. On the backend, the password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storing the user data in MongoDB.

### Login Page:
1. The user provides their email and password.
2. The backend will authenticate the user by comparing the hashed password stored in the database with the password provided during login.
